# Space Coordinate Editor - User Guide

## What is this tool?

The Space Coordinate Editor lets you update the location of spaces (rooms, sensors, equipment) on your floor plan maps by clicking and dragging them to the correct positions.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the tool** at `/Apps/UXP/screen/sensor-space-coordinate-editor`
2. **Select a floor** from the dropdown at the top
3. **Find your space** using the search box or scroll through the list
4. **Click on a space** to select it

## Editing Coordinates

### Visual Editing (Recommended)
1. Click "Edit Coordinates" 
2. Drag the markers on the map to move them
3. Click "Save" when you're satisfied with the position
4. Click "Confirm" to finalize the changes

### Manual Editing
1. Click "Edit Coordinates"
2. Type exact X,Y coordinates in the table
3. Click "Save" then "Confirm"

### Adding/Removing Points
- Click "Add" to create a new coordinate point
- Click the trash icon next to a coordinate to delete it
- Use the copy icon to duplicate a point

## Understanding the Map

**Blue shapes** = Other spaces on the floor  
**Orange shapes** = The space you're currently editing  
**Circles** = Single-point locations (sensors, equipment)  
**Polygons** = Multi-point areas (rooms, zones)

## Search and Filtering

Use the search box to find spaces by name. If your administrator has enabled it, you can also filter spaces by type using the second dropdown.

## Important Notes

- **Save before switching**: Always save your changes before selecting a different space
- **One at a time**: You can only edit one space at a time
- **Confirmation required**: Changes aren't final until you click "Confirm"
- **Cancel anytime**: Click "Cancel" to undo unsaved changes

## Troubleshooting

**Tool won't load?**  
Contact your administrator - the tool needs to be configured with your data sources.

**Can't see the floor plan?**  
Make sure a floor is selected from the dropdown.

**Changes not saving?**  
Check that you clicked both "Save" and "Confirm". If problems persist, contact your administrator.

**Space not showing up?**  
Try clearing the search box or check if type filtering is hiding it.
